# Horiseon

The purpose of this project is to take all of the CSS and HTML knowledge that we have accumulated in the first month of bootcamp and put it to the test. This also gives us a great start in building our professional portfolio.

## Description

![Website Screenshot](./assets/screenshot.png)
This webpage was a challenge to construct due to the stacking of elements and my desire to make everything look good at all viewport sizes. But ultimately, I think I did a pretty good job.
This portfolio webpage is entirely functional and gives anyone who shows up to it ways to contact me and learn a bit about me and my projects. There are also links directly to my deployed projects
for the visitor's convenience.
